# Arduino Sensor
An experimental project with an Arduino Uno linked to an ESP8266 ESP-01 Wifi module. 
It reads temperature, light levels and humidity, and sends the data to ThingSpeak.


The idea behind the project is learning and training, but it may become the basis of future IoT projects.

How it works

##Electronic 

The electronics consists of:
1. An Arduino Uno, mounted next to a breadboard
2. An ESP8266 ESP-01, with standard AT Eprom
3. A Thermister
4. A DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
5. A light-sensitive resistor
